Introduction of Hikaru No Go(an japanese animation)

My program includes 4 web pages. The landing page is a navigation page which includes the headline, the navigation part and footer.
Navigation part looks like a go game board with 4 buttons on it, just like a real go game. Each button turns to a new page--the introduction to characters, the plot of animation, brief introduction to go game and the official website to watch Hikaru No Go.
My webpage structure is drawn on the picture.
The color scheme is also provided with a picture, which is a combination of  Cinnabar, Jasmine, White and Charcoal.
